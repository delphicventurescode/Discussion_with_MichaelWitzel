Some discussion points with Michael Witzel -- not yet communicated to him


THIS PERSPECTIVE IS FROM THE POV OF CYBER-FORENSICS, an area I have had the occassion to gain expertise in
====================================================

Michael Witzel was basically subjected to a lot of trouble by the CAPEEM people. /1/3/
The previous lawsuit went on 4 a long time. May have taken a toll on his health, even. /2/3/
This type of stuff shd not be happening. Lawsuit-based harassment can be really devastating. Not at all fair. Again, should not be happening -since Michael Witzel is just a professor, an academic. /3/3/

Problem for Michael Witzel -- from the POV of Cyber-forensics is this: what can he actually do to the opposition? /1/3/
Those guys are doing everything through Courts of Law. So, legally, everything they are doing is ... for the lack of a better term, not incorrect. /2/3/
If there was something procedurally wrong with what his opponents are doing, then Michael could use that. But his opponents r 2 shrewd 2 make elementary mistakes. They seem 2 have well trained lawyers. /3/3/

The big question for Michael Witzel is -- and this is my advice to him -- try not to make it easy for the Opposition. /1/4/
I had earlier said that maube posting to a List is the best 2 avoid trouble. I no longer think so. /2/4/
I think Michael Witzel could get away with even directly emailing people in the Opposition - as long as he does it at a frequency of, say, once every six months. /3/4/
Also, he needs 2 be careful what he puts on mailing lists (especially, the Yahoo Group Indo-Eurasian-Research-List or something to the effect. It is his and Steve Farmer's baby. But Steve Farmer has no idea what he is doing - at least. he's getting Michael in trouble. /4/4/

By taking various posts that Michael himself makes 2 his List, and interpreting it in a particular way, the Opposing lawyers are constantly putting Witzel, et cetera, on the backfoot. /1/2/
I am coming 2 believe that posting things 2 a List like that is a bad idea - in the first place. Better 2 email the Opposition directl and ask them to stop attacking him. That seems like a very reasonable thing 2 do. /2/2/

Remember - lawyers will be lawyers. /1/3/
They will, ofc, interpret emails and messages however -they- want. /2/3/
They will put a "spin" on it. They will interpret it however suits them best. C'est la vie. /3/3/

 I don't know who is giving Michael Witzel advice. /1/2/
Whoever it is -- that person has probably already screwed up - by letting his client getting into so much trouble. /2/2/
